# Bash-Magic

A bunch of bash files, mainly to update and install software on a freshly set up NTC C.H.I.P. via ssh or serial.
Just download the repo and execute CHIP-Quickinstall.sh and you will be asked for:
	- New username as standard user
	- New network name for C.H.I.P.
	- Locking of local root access (SSH access will be locked on Setup, if selected)
	- Update of repository-links and update / upgrade of forementioned
	- Install of additional software like Snapcasts Snapclient, Node-Red and some hand made user-accessible GPIO scripts (CHIP seems to miss some handy/working WiringPi)
